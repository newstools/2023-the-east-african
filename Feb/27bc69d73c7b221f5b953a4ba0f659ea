The Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) has announced the rescheduling of the start of the standard gauge railway (SGR) journey between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro, covering a stretch of 300 kilometres, to May this year due to delays in the arrival of wagons. TRC issued a statement on Friday saying that the grand testing of the maiden journey, which was earlier slated to take place this month, has been pushed to May.

He added that the government has already disbursed Tsh882 billion ($375.9 million) for the purchase of rolling stock and locomotives that will be used when the construction is over.
