Windhoek US first lady Jill Biden has arrived in Namibia on the first stop on a five-day Africa tour, part of a push by the United States to strengthen its ties on the continent. She landed at the airport in Namibia's capital Windhoek on Wednesday afternoon before heading to Heroes' Acre, a war memorial, together with the first lady of Namibia Monica Geingos. Her trip will focus on education, health and empowering youth and women, she said in a statement on social media. After Namibia she will go to Kenya where she will hear from those affected by drought and food insecurity, she said. The Biden administration is planning a slew of high-level visits to Africa this year in an effort to counter the influence of China and Russia on the continent. South Africa is currently hosting a joint naval exercise with Russia and China, a move the country says is routine but which has alarmed the United States and other Western partners. It is Jill Biden's first trip to Africa as first lady.
