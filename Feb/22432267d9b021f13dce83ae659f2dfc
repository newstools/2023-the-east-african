The Ethiopian government on Thursday said it would sell up to 45 percent of Ethio Telecom, a state-owned monopoly, up from an initial offer of 40 percent. Ethiopia launched the process for the partial sale of the behemoth carrier in 2021 as part of a push to open up the country's tightly controlled economy. The sale ran into headwinds and was postponed last March before the process was re-activated in mid-November, two weeks after the signing of a peace deal to end a two-year war in northern Ethiopia. "The Government of Ethiopia is proposing a partial privatization... by selling up to 45% of the equity share capital of the Company," the Ministry of Finance said in a public advertisement. The government initially launched the process with a view to selling a 40-percent stake, inviting proposals from interested parties.
