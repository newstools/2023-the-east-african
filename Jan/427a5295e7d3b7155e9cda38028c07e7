Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan on Saturday appointed Ministry of Finance permanent secretary Emmanuel Mpawe Tutuba as the new central bank governor. Mr Tutuba replaces Prof Florens Luoga, becoming the eighth governor at the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) since 1966. Prof Luoga exits after his five-year tenure ended. The new BoT governor inherits an economy facing inflationary pressures due to persistent global shocks and high commodity prices. Inflation stood at 4.9 percent in November, about a five-year high.
