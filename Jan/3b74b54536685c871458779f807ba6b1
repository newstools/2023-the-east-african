Gabon's Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Moussa Adamo has died Friday during a cabinet meeting in Libreville, following what sources said was a heart attack. In a tweet, President Ali Bongo Ondimba confirmed the death of the government minister, describing Adamo as a great diplomat and veritable statesman. "To me, he was firstly a friend, loyal and faithful, on whom I have always been able to count. It's a huge loss for Gabon," Bongo said. A former advisor to Ali Bongo, the 62-year-old Adamo was Gabon's ambassador to the United States until 2020 when he was first appointed Defence minister. He was appointed Foreign minister last year.
