Earlier on Monday, the country’s government postponed the opening of primary and secondary schools for at least two weeks in Blantyre and Lilongwe districts. The new term was set to begin on January 3, but the increasing cases of cholera infections and deaths forced the government to cancel school reopening plans as it deals with the outbreak.
