The United States has offered a financial reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of Maalim Ayman, the mastermind of the January 2020 Al Shabaab attack on the Manda Bay airbase in Kenya. The US Department of State said Washington was looking for anyone who could provide information “leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of Maalim Ayman or any individual who committed, attempted, or conspired to commit, or aided or abetted” the attack on the Camp Simba base.
